# UFC Heavyweight Championship game

This Game is my first ever coding project. I am using javascript and p5.js library, also some Dom manipulation. Obviously some basic css and HTML5.

I think it´s a fun game to play mainly due to the idea behind it **(some controvery never hurt anyone :),** based on the Greatest Mixed Martial Artist of all time, if you know Jon Jones, **I have no doubts that you will smile and have a good time playing the game**

Use **Arrows** to move around, while you collect **Belts**, and don´t forget to avoid **past adversaries** as well as the other things that **gave proplems to Jon throughout his carreer.**

## Can you become the best pound for pound fighter in the world?
